# handshake_sync-Verification

A handshake synchronizer is a digital design module used to safely transfer data between different clock domains. It ensures reliable communication without metastability by employing a request-acknowledge handshake mechanism. This repository contains the RTL implementation and testbench for a handshake-based CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) synchronizer.
